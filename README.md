# Social Media Api (MongoDB + Mongoose)

## Description

This repository contains a back end framework for a simple social media app. The back end uses a NoSQL database which is created using MongoDB and Mongoose. It also uses Express and node.js to create a RESTful api. This database works by having 'User' and 'Thought' mongoose models to represent users and user posts. Using the RESTful api, you can create, update, and delete users, thoughts, and reactions to thoughts.
